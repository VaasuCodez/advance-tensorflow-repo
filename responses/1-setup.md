Welcome to the world of machine learning with TensorFlow! Working with TensorFlow can seem intimidating at first, but this tutorial will start with the basics to ensure you have a strong foundation with the package. This tutorial will be focusing on classifying and predicting Pokémon, but the elements discussed within it can certainly be helpful when using TensorFlow for other ideas, as well. Without further ado, let's begin!

First, let's download TensorFlow through `pip`. While you can install the version of TensorFlow that uses your GPU, we'll be using the CPU-driven TensorFlow. Type this into your terminal:

`pip install tensorflow`

Now that it's installed, we can truly begin. Let's import Tensorflow, and a few other packages we'll need. All of this course involve using the command line interface. Enter these commands to import and the necessary packages:

```
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```
